## SmartGarden
This project was created using 2 Arduino UNO starter kits. The main purpose was to have a self-sustaining plant system which has the ability to water itself when required and also provide sunlight to ensure photosynthesis. This was acheived with the use of moisture and light sensors which activated the water pump and LED light system respectively once a certain minima was reached. It also was able to alternate between 2 different modes of manual and auto.
